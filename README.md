# Nuxt Starter Kit (Vue 3 + Vite + TypeScript)

## Setup
```
yarn install --frozen-lockfile

yarn dev
```

NOTE: should have `Node version 16+` installed on your computer

## Features

- I spent a lot of time at my current company working on the propert eslint configurations that play nice with both Prettier and Eslint. Using this starter project saves you all the headache with that. Big shoutout to [Phil](https://github.com/philwhln) for helping out with this. He's a wizard at solving any problem you throw at him.
- Basic Pinia store setup
- Manual Routing setup so you don't have to use `file based routing`
- Testing for JS functions and Vue components with TypeScript make for even better quality testing practices
- TypeScript support/configuration
- Basic Git Action workflow setup to check for linting/test errors
